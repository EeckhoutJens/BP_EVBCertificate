# BP_EVBCertificate
Web3 prototype aimed at creating an NFT certificate for Electric Vehicle Batteries created by Andries Deklerck and Jens Eeckhout. The idea behind our prototype is to offer an insurance to potential buyers of second hand EV's regarding how efficient the battery still is. We also store certain information like recyclable components so that when the battery gets scrapped there is a clear indication of which materials can be reused.

To run the project you first need to make sure you install all necessary packages,you can do this by running npm install in the metamask-app folder through the command prompt

Since we make use of the pinata API an API key is required in order to pin files to IPFS, you can add your key and secret in a .env.local file like this: REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY='key' REACT_APP_PINATA_API_SECRET='secret'

To build and run the project you can run npm start in the metamask-app folder through the command prompt

To see a demonstration of the app in action as well as to see how you can add your minted NFT to metamask you can watch the demovideo that is also included in this repository
